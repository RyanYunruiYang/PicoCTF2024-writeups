# Description:


# Solution:
If we try checking `git log -p -- flag.py` again, we don't get anything. But notice! The flavor text discussed collaboration. And collaboration involves branches. Running `git branch` reveals three additional branches. They each yield:

`print("picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_", end='')`
`print("m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_", end='')`
`print("w0rk_e4b79efb}")`

Presumably one could run some kind of merge command to combine these branches. But that's high effort and copy pasting them together gives `picoCTF{t3@mw0rk_m@k3s_th3_dr3@m_w0rk_e4b79efb}`.
